## üß± Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key components:

* **`oplc/`**: Contains the OPL compiler (`oplc.cpp`), responsible for translating `.opl` source files into assembly code.

* **`OrthodoxLauncher/`**: Houses the launcher application, providing a user interface to access various tools within the Orthodox suite.

* **`stdlib/`**: Includes the standard library files (`base.opl`), offering pre-approved proofs and resolver packs essential for OPL development.

* **`editorwidget.cpp/.h`**: Defines the custom editor widget with syntax highlighting and code completion tailored for OPL.

* **`mainwindow.cpp/.h`**: Implements the main window of the IDE, integrating various components like the editor, standard library viewer, and memory visualizer.

* **`opl.tmLanguage.json`**: Provides syntax definitions for Visual Studio Code, enabling syntax highlighting for `.opl` files.

* **Build Scripts**: Includes `build.bat` and `build.sh` for building the project on Windows and Unix-like systems, respectively.

* **Documentation**: Features `README.md` and `press-kit.md`, offering detailed information about the project, its philosophy, and usage.
